### cipher lock

A cipher lock, shown in Figure 2, uses buttons that a user presses in a given sequence to open the door. It is possible to program a cipher lock. This means that a userâ€™s code may only work during certain days or certain times. For example, a cipher lock may only allow Bob access to the server room between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. Cipher locks can also keep a record of when the door opened, and the code used to open i

### Radio frequency identification (RFID) 
uses radio waves to identify and track objects. RFID inventory systems use tags attached to all items that an organization wants to track. The tags contain an integrated circuit that connects to an antenna. RFID tags are small and require very little power, so they do not need a battery to store information to exchange with a reader. RFID can help automate asset tracking or wirelessly lock, unlock, or configure electronic devices.

RFID systems operate within different frequencies. Low frequency systems have a shorter read range and slower data read rates, but are not as sensitive to radio wave interference caused by liquids and metals that are present. Higher frequencies have a faster data transfer rate and longer read ranges, but are more sensitive to radio wave interference.
