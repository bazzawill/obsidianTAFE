1. A LAMP webserver consists of:

Linux - The operating system

Apache - The webserver that serves http requests for html files, images, videos, and javascript, css and other files

MySQL - Is a database

PHP - Is the backend scripting 



2. JavaScript is used for front end scripting as it is the only language natively supported by a browser. 

However recently it has been made possible to run Python using PyScript that uses JavaScript in the browser to run Python code



3. PHP is the default backend scripting language in  a LAMP stack. However it is also possible to use Python, or, Perl (without changing the acronym)

Comment:
LAMP architecture:

The physical layout of a web server is usually just one web server which has a database installed as well. You could have the database installed on another server if there is enough traffic.

API (JSON, or SOAP),



2. 

Load balancing

Dynamic webpages

Shared database / resources

Additional resources to process large data (CPU / RAM / storage), increased performance

Additional security / protection from attack
