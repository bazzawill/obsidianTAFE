Dear Angela Birk,

I am excited to apply for the IT Help Desk Support position that was recently posted on your Indeed. I am currently transitioning my employment from teaching which I found to be unsuitable for me long term into ICT. In my 6 years as a digital technologies teacher I also provided IT support to my colleagues. I am confident that I have the skills and expertise necessary to excel in this role.

I have had an interest in all aspects of ICT my entire life. I have taught myself operating systems, networking, programming, and a variety of other IT skills. I am currently undertaking formal training in cyber security. In my previous roles, I have provided support and troubleshooting in a busy team environment, which has prepared me to hit the ground running in this position. I am skilled in MS Outlook troubleshooting, basic network diagnosis and troubleshooting, printer and other peripherals installation, administration and troubleshooting, Microsoft AD account creation and user account administration, Microsoft Exchange Server account creations and user mailbox administration, and PC hardware administration and troubleshooting. I am also troubleshooting system issues relating to both hardware and software.

As a strong communicator, I have the ability to relay information in a clear and concise manner, whether by email, over the phone or in person. I have a keen eye for detail and the ability to learn and apply problem-solving techniques. With a friendly manner and a willingness to help users/clients with numerous IT issues, I am confident that I can provide excellent customer service to your clients. I am also excited about the opportunity to pursue a career in IT and grow my skills in this field.

In addition to my experience, I have a strong understanding of Windows 10, 11 and Office 365, Windows Server 2012/r2, 2016/r2, 2022. I have experience in IPv4 TCP/IP Protocols, knowledge/experience in TCP/IP Routing (Switches, Routers, Firewalls, etc.), and knowledge of cloud-based solutions. I possess excellent multitasking skills, written and verbal communication skills, and strong attention to detail.

I am excited about the opportunity to join a supportive, down-to-earth and family-friendly team culture that values work-life balance. With a competitive salary and free parking, I am confident that this is the perfect opportunity for me.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my updated resume for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Barry Williams
