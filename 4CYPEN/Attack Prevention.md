The easiest way is to use a firewall with allow and deny rules. In simple cases, attacks come from a small number of IP addresses, so you can detect those IP addresses and then add a block rule in the firewall. But this method will fail in some cases. We know that a firewall comes at a very deep level inside the network hierarchy, so a large amount of traffic may affect the router before reaching the firewall. Blackholing and sinkholing are newer approaches. Blackholing detects the fake attacking traffic and sends it to a black hole. Sinkholing routes all traffic to a valid IP address where traffic is analyzed. Here, it rejects back packets.![[JTS Floormap.drawio.svg]]
